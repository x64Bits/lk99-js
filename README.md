The ultimate levitation experience for your JavaScript projects, backed by the power of science! 🔬✨

## What is LK99-js Superconductor?

LK99-js Superconductor is a groundbreaking JavaScript library that harnesses the power of the new LK-99 superconductive material. With the principles of superconductivity at its core, this library empowers you to make your HTML elements float gracefully in mid-air, defying gravity like true scientists. 🚀

## Getting Started

To embark on this scientific journey, follow these simple steps:

1. **Installation**

   Start by installing LK99-js Superconductor using your preferred package manager:

   ```bash
   yarn add @realscientists/lk99
   ```

   Alternatively, you can include the script directly in your HTML:

   ```html
   <script src="path/to/index.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Usage**

   Once the library is set up, it's time to unleash the science. Call the `lk99()` function with the `selector` parameter to grant levitation abilities to specific elements:

   ```javascript
   // Levitate all elements inside the second child <div> of the <nav> element
   lk99("nav > div:nth-child(2)");
   ```

   Take your scientific endeavors a step further by using the `track` parameter to turn your cursor into a magnetic force, attracting levitating elements:

   ```javascript
   // Levitate all elements with the default selector while tracking the cursor magnetically
   lk99(undefined, true);
   ```

3. **Prepare for Awe-inspiring Discoveries!**

   For optimal results, ensure that your HTML elements have a transparent background – this will reveal the true essence of superconductivity! 🔍🔬
